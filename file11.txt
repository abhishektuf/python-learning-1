Lenovo owned smartphone brand Motorola has capitalised heavily on its budget-oriented G series in India. The brand has continuously launched phones in the sub Rs 15,000 range and has garnered impressive sales figures for the same. Motorola phones have been praised for their stock Android experience, superb build quality and other features which it avails at this price range. However, this price segment seems to be growing competitive at a very unprecedented rate. Just a few months ago, Xiaomi was the only competitor in this segment, and Motorola was easily able to dominate the market using the G series of smartphones.
